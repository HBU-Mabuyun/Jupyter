    "From this, you can see that if you wanted your neural network to be long chains of affine compositions, that this adds no new power to your model than just doing a single affine map.\n",
    "\n",

    "你可能在想：“为什么这些函数？我能想到很多其他的非线性。”\n",

    "The reason for this is that they have gradients that are easy to compute, and computing gradients is essential for learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "这样做的原因是它们的梯度很容易计算，而计算梯度对于学习是必不可少的。\n",
    "\n",

    "A quick note: \n",
